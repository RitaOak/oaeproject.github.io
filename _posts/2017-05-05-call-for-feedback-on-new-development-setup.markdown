<p>As part of our strategy of attracting the development community to OAE, we have recently began the task of making the project more approachable to newcomers with simpler steps and instructions. The major changes consist of using docker containers instead of requiring manual installation of all the components that comprise OAE, as well as the use of git submodules.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As we approach the final stage of this task, we would like to invite the community to try this setup and give us feedback so we can refine and polish the documentation (and fix any bugs that might still be left).</p>
<p>Feedback is most welcome and may be given through the slack channel (via #general on apereo-oae.slack.com) or e-mail (oae@apereo.org). The instructions are here: https://github.com/oaeproject/Hilary/wiki/Call-for-feedback-on-docker-install-and-setup-instructions</p>
<p>We are very excited about making docker containers available to everyone and we hope this milestone sets the path to better collaboration in the future!</p>
